Problem Description: 
One of the frustrations here at the GMU C4I & Cyber Centerhas been not being able to find people rapidly who are working on related topics be they AI, cybersecurity, European politics, community resilience, etc.  Mason tried to assemble an "experts"list a few years ago based on keywords, but it's been hard to keep current.

Project Goals:
A good data analytics problem for students might be to write a bot that would check out (a) PeopleFinder, (b) bios for Mason faculty and researchers, (c) Google Scholar, ResearchGate, etc. to assemble lists of people working in particular areas. If successful, it could be re-runperiodically to keep the roster updated without burdening the scholars. Some kind of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval might be needed, but all the material would be public domain so it should not be a problem.
